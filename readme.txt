DataDome plugin gives users access to Dashboards to follow up on traffic quality and understand bot activity on their websites.

== Description ==

= Bot Detection =
Follow the evolution of traffic generated by Humans, Good Bots, Bad Bots and commercial Bots.
Big data for security: since 2014, our partner websites have been equipped with DataDome modules, set up directly on their web servers, analyzing all incoming traffic in real time. The hit fingerprints will automatically be enriched with elements from proprietary databases, and then screened for technical and behavioural criteria, whose combinations are the root of DataDomeâ€™s bot detection algorithm.

= Quality of traffic acquisition =
Track which referers (natural and paid) bring traffic (human vs bot).

= Security =
Observe and understand massive attacks against your website. 

= Alert =
Real-time email alerts help users understand what types of content bots are after.


== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and configure it:

1. Get you API keys on https://datadome.co/free-signup/
2. install the plugin through the WordPress 'Plugins' screen or upload the plugin zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
4. Enter the API key and JS Key and click 'Save Changes' in the DataDome settings

= Advanced settings =
By default, DataDome Wordpress Plugin will run latency tests with all DataDome API Servers to select the fastest.
You can run ths test again by clicking on the "Detect Best Server" button.
You can configure the timeout for each API request (range: 50ms-1000ms). The plugin overhead will never go beyond the configured timeout.

You can activate HTTPS connections with API Server. Please note that SSL protocol will increase latency (40ms on average).

== Requirements ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is DataDome bot detection free? =

Yes! DataDome provides free bot detection and traffic analyses via real-time dashboards.
If you are interested in bot mitigation to act against unwanted bot trafic we do have a premium service.

= How DataDome detects bots? =

Being deployed on hundreds of websites, DataDome collects billions of fingerprints and has built powerful in-memory databases.
The fingerprints will automatically be enriched with elements from proprietary databases, and then screened for technical and behavioural criteria, whose combinations are the root of DataDome's bot detection algorithm.
More information here: https://datadome.co/the-art-of-bot-detection/

= Why does the plugin make calls to DataDome API Server? =

DataDome is able to detect bots and distributed crawlers that would otherwise remain under the radar.
This technology requires huge in-memory databases and complex algorithms that cannot be embeded in a Wordpress plugin.
That's why the plugin needs to interact with our API Servers.

= What is the difference with other security solutions/plugins? =

Bot algorithms are getting more and more complex.
Most sophisticated crawlers are now distributed over thousands of IP, they use spoofed UserAgent, are able to execute JavaScript and behave like a regular browser.
Technology based on UserAgent databases or IP blacklists cannot detect this kind of bot activity.

= Why do I need a DataDome account? =

DataDome account will provide you license keys to allow communication with our API Servers.
Sign-up for free: https://datadome.co/free-signup/

= What kind of information does DataDome use? =

Detecting bot activity requires analyzing the fingerprint which includes the IP, UserAgent and some meta information.
User cookies and post param are not sent to the API.

= What about latency? =

DataDome has deployed API Servers in a few locations to bring network latency to its lowest.
During the setup, each API Server is tested and the plugin will select the fastest datacenter available.
We generaly notice an average value of 30ms.
The timeout setting allows you to set a maximum time to ensure user experience never gets impacted.
